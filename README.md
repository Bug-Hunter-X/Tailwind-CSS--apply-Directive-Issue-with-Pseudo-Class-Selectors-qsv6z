This repository demonstrates a bug in Tailwind CSS where the `@apply` directive fails to correctly apply styles when used with pseudo-class selectors like `:hover`.  The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a workaround. The issue is related to the way Tailwind processes and merges CSS classes during the build process.  This usually occurs when complex class names are combined with pseudo-classes, causing unexpected behavior. The solution involves applying the styles directly or using a utility-first approach.
